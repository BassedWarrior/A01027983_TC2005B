    <h2>a - Anchor</h2>
    <p>
        An anchor provides a link to a page or resource. By using the 
        <i>href</i> attribute, one can specify either a relative or absolute 
        path for the page or resource the anchor links with. An example would 
        be a link to the TEC page which sells the tickets for LiFE's upcoming 
        event: VESUS Divxs, in which I will partake in on May 28 as a lead 
        singer. <a href="https://bit.ly/49TGvA7">Link a los boletos</a>.

    <h2>p - Paragraph</h2>
    <p>
        A paragraph provides a space where text can be written in block-style, 
        such that two paragraphs are not displayed next to one another, and 
        are instead displayed below one another sequentially according to the 
        order they were written in, in the \<body\> tag of the <em>html</em> 
        file.
